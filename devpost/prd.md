# Ghostlisted — Product Requirements

Before you apply, find out if anyone's really hiring.  
Source: `scope.md > The Unique Kernel`, `scope.md > Who It's For`, `scope.md > The Core Loop`, `scope.md > The POC Boundary`.

## The Core Journey
1. **Arrival**: User arrives at a single-page web app featuring the app name, tagline, and a concise summary of the three signal types checked (Scam, Ghost, and Fresher-Mismatch).
2. **Input**: User selects one of three input tabs:
   - *Paste text*: Direct text area for pasting raw job post text (English or Bengali).
   - *Upload screenshot*: File selector / drag-and-drop for post screenshots (extracted text is displayed on screen).
   - *Try a sample*: Selection of 3 pre-loaded fictional job posts (one Scam-like, one Ghost-like, one Fresher-mismatch) with invented company names.
3. **Context Selection**: User answers 3 quick chip-selection questions:
   - *Where did you find it?* (LinkedIn / Job board / Facebook group / WhatsApp or Telegram / Company website / Other)
   - *How old is the post?* (Under 1 week / 1-4 weeks / 1-3 months / Over 3 months / Not sure)
   - *Have you seen it reposted?* (Yes / No / Not sure)  
   *(Questions default to "Not sure" / "Other" if unselected)*
4. **Submit**: The "Check this post" button activates as soon as input text or image is present.
5. **Loading**: App shows progressive step labels ("Reading the post" → "Looking for signals" → "Checking quotes") instead of a generic spinner.
6. **Report Generation**: Within seconds, the user receives an evidence-based report:
   - *Post View*: Displays full post text (or OCR-extracted screenshot text) with quoted evidence highlighted in lane-specific highlighter colors.
   - *Three Signal Lanes*: Scam signals (translucent red `#E5484D`), Ghost signals (translucent highlighter yellow `#F5C400`), and Fresher-mismatch signals (translucent blue `#2F6FDB`). Each lane shows signal strength (Low / Medium / High), quoted text, and a plain-language explanation.
   - *Interactive Highlights*: Clicking any signal item in a lane card smooth-scrolls to and pulses its highlighted line in the Post View.
   - *Recommended Move*: Displays a rubber-stamp badge (**Apply** / **Verify first** / **Skip**) plus 2-3 concrete verification steps.
   - *Persistent Disclaimer*: Footer note stating: *"Signals, not verdicts. A post can't prove what a company decides internally."*
7. **Reset**: User clicks "Check another post" to clear state and evaluate another listing.

## Screens and Layout
Single-page application operating in two distinct view states:

- **Input State**: Centered, focused layout containing hero header, 3 input tabs, text/file input area, context question chips, and the primary "Check this post" action button.
- **Report State**:
  - **Desktop Layout**: Two-column layout with Post View (with inline highlighted quotes) on the left, and the right column containing the Next Move rubber stamp + verification steps at the top, followed by the 3 Signal Lane cards below.
  - **Mobile Layout**: Responsive vertical stack ordering: Next Move stamp first, followed by Signal Lane cards, followed by the highlighted Post View.

## Look and Feel
- **Visual Direction**: "Case File" — styled like an investigator's physical evidence file.
- **Color Palette**: Warm off-white paper background (`#F4F1EA`), ink-black typography (`#1B1B1B`).
- **Typography**:
  - Headings: Editorial serif (*Fraunces*).
  - Body Text: Clean sans-serif (*IBM Plex Sans*).
  - Post / Source Text: Typewriter-style monospace (*IBM Plex Mono*).
- **Highlighter Signal Styling**:
  - Scam Signals: Translucent red highlighter stroke (`#E5484D` tint) behind ink text + warning icon.
  - Ghost Signals: Translucent highlighter yellow stroke (`#F5C400` tint) behind ink text + ghost icon.
  - Fresher-Mismatch Signals: Translucent blue highlighter stroke (`#2F6FDB` tint) behind ink text + mismatch icon.
  - *Accessibility*: High contrast ink text, translucent tints behind text, plus a lane icon and text label so color is never the sole indicator.
- **Next Move Stamp**: Rubber-stamp graphic with slight rotational angle.
- **Explicitly Avoided**: Purple/blue AI gradients, glassmorphism, chat bubbles, emoji-heavy UI, generic dashboard cards.
- **Accessibility & Usability**: Visible focus states, keyboard-usable tabs and context chips.

## Features and Behavior

### Deterministic Application Rules (App Logic)
- **Quote Validation Rule**: Any signal quote returned by the AI that cannot be found strictly inside the post text is dropped before rendering.
- **Context Signal Rule**: The 3 context answers are sent with the post. Signals based only on a context answer (e.g. post older than 3 months, seen reposted) are shown in their lane with the label 'From your answers' instead of a quote. They are not highlighted in the Post View and are exempt from the Quote Validation Rule. All other signals must quote the post.
- **Next Move Logic Matrix**:
  - **Skip**: Triggered if Scam lane strength is **High**.
  - **Verify First**: Triggered if any lane strength is **Medium** or **High** (and Scam is not High).
  - **Apply**: Default when all lanes are **Low** or have no signals.
- **Empty Lane Rule**: A lane with zero signals displays *"No [lane] signals found in this post."* (Never states "safe" or "verified clean").

### Input & Text Extraction
- **Text & Screenshot Processing**: Handles raw text or screenshot image upload. Extracted text from screenshots is displayed on screen and used for inline quote highlighting.
- **Sample Selection**: 3 built-in fictional posts (Scam-like, Ghost-like, Fresher-mismatch) with invented company names for instant demo testing.

### Interactive Signal Reporting
- **Highlight Interactivity**: Clicking a signal card item scrolls the Post View to the matching quote line and triggers a visual pulse effect.

## States and Boundaries

- **Input State**: Default view with input tabs and disabled CTA until text/image is provided.
- **Loading State**: Step-by-step progress indicator ("Reading the post", "Looking for signals", "Checking quotes").
- **Report State**: Complete report layout with Post View, Signal Lanes, Next Move Stamp, and "Check another post" reset button.
- **Short Text Error**: Friendly message when submitted text is too short, requesting the full job post.
- **Invalid Input Error**: Displays *"This doesn't look like a job post"* with a direct link to try a sample post.
- **Invalid Image Error**: Only JPG, PNG, or WebP images up to 4 MB are accepted; anything else shows a clear message before any analysis runs.
- **Unreadable Screenshot Error**: Prompts user to upload a clearer image or paste text manually.
- **API Error / Rate Limit**: Displays an error message with a "Retry" button. For built-in sample posts, falls back to a saved example result labeled *"Saved example result"*.
- **Privacy & Data Boundary**: Zero user data saved. Footer note states: *"Post text is sent to an AI service for analysis and is not stored."*

## Product Decisions
- **"Case File" Investigator Aesthetic**: Establishes an objective, evidence-based tone rather than a generic AI chat or dashboard wrapper.
- **Deterministic Guardrails**: Guarantees reliability by filtering missing quotes in app code and calculating next moves via explicit rules rather than trusting raw AI outputs.
- **Social Media Screenshot Focus**: Direct support for image posts from Facebook job groups and WhatsApp/Telegram forwards where many openings are shared but never appear on job boards.
- **Built-in Sample Fallbacks**: Ensures robust hackathon demo execution even during API downtime or rate limits.

## What We're Building
- Single-page application supporting Input and Report states.
- 3 input tabs (Paste text, Screenshot upload with text extraction display, 3 Fictional samples).
- 3 context chip questions.
- Step-by-step loading state.
- 3-lane signal report (Scam, Ghost, Fresher Mismatch) with strength levels, verbatim quotes, and plain-language explanations.
- Highlighted post text view with pulse navigation on signal selection.
- Deterministic quote validation, context signal handling, and next-move stamp calculation.
- Fallback cached results for built-in sample posts.
- Fully responsive "Case File" UI with accessible contrast, fonts, and keyboard navigation.

## Deferred From the POC
- Community signal voting & crowd-sourced warning reports.
- Browser extension for inline job board checking.
- User accounts and saved check history.
- Direct URL job scraping.

## Possible Later Enhancements
- Multi-language UI translation (currently Bengali job text is supported while UI remains English).
- Company credibility lookup integration.

## Non-Goals
- Ghostlisted will not output definitive verdicts like "This post is 100% fake".
- Ghostlisted will not store user submissions or scraped data.
- Ghostlisted will not provide resume optimization or job search functionality.

## Open Questions
None. All functional, behavioral, edge-case, and visual design requirements have been fully specified by the learner.
